# website

This is the beginning of my journey. Where I am going? I am not quite sure. 

Year: 2020 Month: 03 Day: 14

I want to be able to build beautiful serverless websites.
I want to be able to turn my ideas into tangibles.
I want to integrate different tools to make something greater.
I want to take give people value.
